## Learning Objectives

By the end of dis curriculum, you go dey confident and excited about your new skills. Here na wetin you go achieve:

• **Understand MCP fundamentals**: You go sabi wetin Model Context Protocol be and why e dey change how AI applications dey work together, using analogies and examples wey make sense.

• **Build your first MCP server**: You go create working MCP server for your preferred programming language, starting wit simple examples and grow your skills step by step.

• **Connect AI models to real tools**: You go learn how to link AI models to actual services, giving your applications powerful new abilities.

• **Implement security best practices**: You go sabi how to keep your MCP implementations safe and secure, to protect both your applications and your users.

• **Deploy with confidence**: You go know how to carry your MCP projects from development go production, wit deployment strategies wey work well for real world.

• **Join the MCP community**: You go become part of growing community of developers wey dey shape the future of AI application development.

## Essential Background

Before we dive into MCP specifics, make we make sure you comfortable wit some foundation concepts. No worry if you no be expert for these areas - we go explain everything wey you need as we go!

### Understanding Protocols (The Foundation)

Think protocol like rules for conversation. When you call friend, both of una sabi say una go say "hello" when una answer, una go take turn to talk, and una go talk "goodbye" when una don finish. Computer programs need similar rules to talk well.

MCP na protocol - set of agreed rules wey dey help AI models and applications get productive "conversations" wit tools and services. Just like how conversation rules make human talk smoother, MCP make AI application communication more reliable and better.

### Client-Server Relationships (How Programs Work Together)

You dey use client-server relationships every day! When you use web browser (the client) to visit website, you dey connect to web server wey go send you the page content. Browser sabi how to ask for information, server sabi how to respond.

For MCP, e get similar relationship: AI models act as clients wey dey request information or actions, MCP servers dey provide those capabilities. E be like you get assistant (the server) wey AI fit ask to do specific work.

### Why Standardization Matters (Making Things Work Together)

Imagine say every car manufacturer get different shape gas pumps - you go need different adapter for each car! Standardization mean say everybody agree on common way so things fit work together smoothly.

MCP dey provide dis standardization for AI applications. Instead make every AI model need custom code to work wit every tool, MCP create universal way for them to reconnect. Dis mean say developers fit build tools once and dem go work wit many AI systems.

## 🧭 Your Learning Path Overview

Your MCP journey dey structured well well to build your confidence and skills one step at a time. Every phase go show new concepts and reinforce wetin you don sabi before.

### 🌱 Foundation Phase: Understanding the Basics (Modules 0-2)

Na here your adventure start! We go introduce you to MCP concepts using familiar analogies and simple examples. You go understand wetin MCP be, why e dey, and how e fit into the bigger AI development world.

• **Module 0 - Introduction to MCP**: We go start by explaining wetin MCP be and why e important for modern AI applications. You go see real-life examples of MCP for action and understand how e dey solve common problems developers dey face.

• **Module 1 - Core Concepts Explained**: Here you go learn di essential building blocks of MCP. We go use plenti analogies and visual examples to make sure these concepts easy to understand.

• **Module 2 - Security in MCP**: Security fit sound fear, but we go show you how MCP get built-in safety features and teach you best practices to protect your applications from the beginning.

### 🔨 Building Phase: Creating Your First Implementations (Module 3)

Now the real fun don start! You go get hands-on experience to build actual MCP servers and clients. No worry - we go start simple and guide you step by step.
Dis module get plenti hands-on guides wey go make you practice for your preferred programming language. You go create your first server, build client wey go connect to am, and even join am with popular development tools like VS Code.

Each guide get complete code examples, troubleshooting tips, and explanations of why we dey make specific design choices. By di end of dis phase, you go get working MCP implementations wey you fit proud of!

### 🚀 Growing Phase: Advanced Concepts and Real-World Application (Modules 4-5)
