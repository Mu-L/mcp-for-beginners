## Learning Objectives

By di time you finish dis curriculum, you go feel confident and excited about your new skills. See wetin you go achieve:

• **Understand MCP fundamentals**: You go understand wetin Model Context Protocol be and why e dey change how AI applications dey work together, with examples wey go make sense.

• **Build your first MCP server**: You go create working MCP server inside your preferred programming language, start from simple examples and build your skill step by step.

• **Connect AI models to real tools**: You go learn how to connect AI models with real services, give your applications powerful new abilities.

• **Implement security best practices**: You go know how to keep your MCP implementations safe and secure, protect your applications and users.

• **Deploy with confidence**: You go sabi how to carry your MCP projects from development go production, with real hands practical deployment strategies.

• **Join the MCP community**: You go join beta group of developers wey dey shape the future of AI application development. 

## Essential Background

Before we start to talk about MCP specifics, make sure you sabi some foundation concepts well well. No worry if you no be expert for these areas – we go explain everything for you as you waka along!

### Understanding Protocols (Di Foundation)

Think protocol like the rules for how person go dey talk. When you call your padi, both of una know say make una greet "hello" when una talk, make una take turns, and say "goodbye" when una finish. Computer programs also need similar rules to dey talk well well.

MCP na protocol - set of agreed rules wey help AI models and applications to dey do better "conversations" with tools and services. Just like how talk rules make human communication soft, MCP dey make AI application communication steady and powerful.

### Client-Server Relationships (How Programs Dey Work Together)

You don dey use client-server relationships every day! When you dey use web browser (client) to visit website, you dey connect to web server wey dey send you page content. Browser sabi how to ask for info, server sabi how to reply.

For MCP, e get similar relationship: AI models dey act as clients wey dey request info or actions, MCP servers dey provide those abilities. E be like sey na helper (server) dey there wey AI fit ask to do certain work.

### Why Standardization Matters (Make Things Work Together)

Imagine if every car maker dey use different gas pump shape - you go need different adapter for each car! Standardization mean make everybody agree on common way so things go fit work together well.

MCP na di standardization for AI applications. Instead of every AI model to need special code to work with every tool, MCP create one universal way for all to talk. This one mean say developers fit build tool once and e go work with many AI systems.

## 🧭 Your Learning Path Overview

Your MCP journey get correct plan to build your confidence and skills small small. Every phase go show you new concepts and also remind you wetin you don learn.

### 🌱 Foundation Phase: Understand di Basics (Modules 0-2)

Na here your adventure begin! We go show you MCP concepts with familiar examples and simple explanations. You go understand what MCP be, why e dey, and how e take join di big AI development world.

• **Module 0 - Introduction to MCP**: We go start by explain wetin MCP be and why e important for modern AI applications. You go see real-world examples of MCP and how e solve common problems wey developers dey face.

• **Module 1 - Core Concepts Explained**: Here you go learn main building blocks of MCP. We go use plenty analogies and visual examples so that these concepts go clear and easy to understand.

• **Module 2 - Security in MCP**: Security fit scare, but we go show you how MCP get safety features inside and teach you best ways to protect your applications from day one.

### 🔨 Building Phase: Create Your First Implementations (Module 3)

Now real fun dey begin! You go do hands-on work to build real MCP servers and clients. No worry - we go start simple and carry you step by step.

This module get many hands-on guides wey make you practice for your preferred programming language. You go create your first server, build client to connect am, and even join popular development tools like VS Code.
